By publishing content, you grant Boora a free license to use, display, and distribute such content within the platform, only for the app’s operation, promotion, and safety.

### 6.1. App screenshots (prints) in promotions

To promote Boora, we sometimes use **screenshots (screen captures) of the app** on our social media, website, and app store pages (App Store/Google Play).

In these screenshots, **your profile photo and/or username may appear**, if they are visible on the screen at the time the screenshot is taken.

If you don’t want that to happen, you can ask us to remove or replace the material, when possible.

Boora may moderate, remove, or limit content at any time.

Boora does not read private messages, except when there is a report or an automated risk signal.
