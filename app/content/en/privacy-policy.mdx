If you don’t want that to happen, you can ask us to remove or replace the material, when possible.

**Boora does not sell your data and does not display personalized behavioral advertising.**

## 4. LOCATION

## 5. MODERATION AND SAFETY

To keep the community safe:

- Uploaded images may be automatically analyzed to detect inappropriate content;
- Flagged content may be reviewed by human moderators;
- We do not use your images to train external AI models.

**Private messages are not read, except in case of a report or automated risk signal.**

### 5.1. Profile Images and Facial Data

Our app allows users to upload profile images that may contain facial data.

**What facial data do we collect?**

We collect only the profile images that you voluntarily choose to upload. These images may contain visible facial features in the photo (such as face, expressions, etc.). We do not extract, process, or store biometric data separately from the original image.

**How do we use facial data?**

Profile images are used exclusively for:
- Display on your public profile within the platform;
- Visual identification in activities and interactions with other users;
- Display in chats and messages.

We do not perform facial recognition, biometric analysis, automated identification, or any processing of facial features beyond displaying the image.

**Sharing and storage:**

- **Third-party sharing:** We do not share your profile images with third parties for commercial or marketing purposes. Images may be visible to other users of the app according to the privacy settings you choose.
- **Storage:** Images are stored securely on cloud hosting servers (infrastructure providers that follow security standards), with encryption and protection against unauthorized access.

**Data retention:**

Your profile images are retained while your account is active. When you delete your account, all your profile images are permanently removed from our systems, in accordance with our data deletion policy.

## 6. DATA SHARING

We may share data only when necessary:

- With other users, according to the app settings (e.g., public profile);
- With technology providers that help operate the app (e.g., hosting, analytics, chat), always under confidentiality obligations;
- To comply with legal obligations or court orders;
- To protect the rights, safety, and integrity of Boora and its users.

**We do not share personal data with commercial partners for marketing purposes.**

## 7. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

Boora may use third-party services for essential functionality, such as:

- Hosting and databases;
- Usage and performance analytics;
- Messaging and chat;
- Content moderation;
- Identity verification.

Each service follows its own privacy policies.

### 7.1. Identity Verification via Didit

To increase security and trust in the community, Boora offers the option of identity verification through the **Didit** platform ([https://didit.me/](https://didit.me/)).

**How it works:**

- Identity verification is **optional** and voluntary;
- When you choose to verify your identity, you are directed to the Didit platform;
- Didit is a third-party, independent service responsible for processing and validating your identification data;
- Boora receives only confirmation that your identity has been verified, without access to the original documents.

**Data processed by Didit:**

Didit may collect and process identification documents (such as ID cards, driver's licenses, or passports) and perform biometric verification as necessary for the verification process. This data is processed exclusively by Didit.

**Didit's Privacy Policy:**

The processing of your identification data by Didit is governed by their own privacy policy. We recommend that you read Didit's privacy policy before starting the verification process: [https://didit.me/](https://didit.me/)

**Use of verification:**

- The "verified" status is displayed on your profile to increase trust from other users;
