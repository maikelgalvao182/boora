## 1. INTRODUCTION

Boora respects your privacy and takes the protection of your data seriously.

This Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information when you use the Boora app, our website, and other related services.

**By using Boora, you agree to this Privacy Policy.**

### 1.1. PUBLIC NATURE OF PROFILES

**By creating a profile on Boora, you acknowledge that your public profile information (such as name, photo, interests, and created activities) may be viewed by other members of the platform.**

Profiles are public within the platform, and there is no expectation of privacy regarding data displayed publicly on the profile. This is necessary for the social functioning of the app.

### 3.1. Legal Basis for Data Processing (LGPD/GDPR)

In compliance with data protection regulations (Brazilian LGPD - Law No. 13,709/2018 and GDPR where applicable), the processing of your personal data is based on the following legal grounds:

- **Contract performance** (Art. 7, V of LGPD / Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR): to create and manage your account, enable participation in activities, and facilitate communication between users;

### 3.2. Screenshots (prints) in promotional materials

To promote Boora, we sometimes use **screenshots (screen captures) of the app** on our social media, website, and app store pages (App Store/Google Play).

In these screenshots, **your profile photo and/or username may appear**, if they are visible on the screen at the time the screenshot is taken.

If you don’t want that to happen, you can ask us to remove or replace the material, when possible.

**Boora does not sell your data and does not display personalized behavioral advertising.**

## 4. LOCATION

- We use your location only in an approximate form;
- Other users never see your exact point;
- You can disable location use in your device settings, noting that some features may not work properly.

## 5. MODERATION AND SAFETY

To keep the community safe:

- Uploaded images may be automatically analyzed to detect inappropriate content;
- Flagged content may be reviewed by human moderators;
- We do not use your images to train external AI models.

**Private messages are not read, except in case of a report or automated risk signal.**

### 5.1. Profile Images and Facial Data

Our app allows users to upload profile images that may contain facial data.

**What facial data do we collect?**

We collect only the profile images that you voluntarily choose to upload. These images may contain visible facial features in the photo (such as face, expressions, etc.). We do not extract, process, or store biometric data separately from the original image.

**How do we use facial data?**

Profile images are used exclusively for:
- Display on your public profile within the platform;
- Visual identification in activities and interactions with other users;
- Display in chats and messages.

We do not perform facial recognition, biometric analysis, automated identification, or any processing of facial features beyond displaying the image.

**Sharing and storage:**

- **Third-party sharing:** We do not share your profile images with third parties for commercial or marketing purposes. Images may be visible to other users of the app according to the privacy settings you choose.
- **Storage:** Images are stored securely on cloud hosting servers (infrastructure providers that follow security standards), with encryption and protection against unauthorized access.

**Data retention:**

Your profile images are retained while your account is active. When you delete your account, all your profile images are permanently removed from our systems, in accordance with our data deletion policy.

## 6. DATA SHARING

We may share data only when necessary:

- With other users, according to the app settings (e.g., public profile);
- With technology providers that help operate the app (e.g., hosting, analytics, chat), always under confidentiality obligations;
- To comply with legal obligations or court orders;
- To protect the rights, safety, and integrity of Boora and its users.

**We do not share personal data with commercial partners for marketing purposes.**

## 7. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

Boora may use third-party services for essential functionality, such as:

- Hosting and databases;
- Usage and performance analytics;
- Messaging and chat;
- Content moderation;
- Identity verification.

Each service follows its own privacy policies.

### 7.1. Identity Verification via Didit

To increase security and trust in the community, Boora offers the option of identity verification through the **Didit** platform ([https://didit.me/](https://didit.me/)).

**How it works:**

- Identity verification is **optional** and voluntary;
- When you choose to verify your identity, you are directed to the Didit platform;
- Didit is a third-party, independent service responsible for processing and validating your identification data;
- Boora receives only confirmation that your identity has been verified, without access to the original documents.

**Data processed by Didit:**

Didit may collect and process identification documents (such as ID cards, driver's licenses, or passports) and perform biometric verification as necessary for the verification process. This data is processed exclusively by Didit.

**Facial Data Storage by Didit:**

Didit, as the third party responsible for identity verification, **stores facial and biometric data** collected during the verification process. According to Didit's privacy policy:

- **Why Didit stores facial data:** Biometric data is stored to enable the maintenance, development, and management of identity verification services provided to users, as well as for legal and regulatory compliance purposes.

- **Storage period:** Biometric data is stored while the user's consent remains valid for receiving verification services. After consent is revoked, data is retained for the legally established periods of conservation and prescription of responsibilities.

- **Justification for the storage period:** Storage during the service period is necessary for the execution of the identity verification service. Retention after consent revocation is based on legal data conservation obligations and legally prescribed limitation periods.

- **Legal basis:** The processing of biometric data intended to unequivocally identify an individual is based on the user's **explicit consent**, as required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable legislation.

**Didit's Privacy Policy:**

The processing of your identification data by Didit is governed by their own privacy policy. We recommend that you read Didit's privacy policy before starting the verification process: [https://didit.me/terms/privacy-policy](https://didit.me/terms/privacy-policy)

**Use of verification:**

- The "verified" status is displayed on your profile to increase trust from other users;
- Verification does not guarantee the integrity or behavior of the user;
- Boora reserves the right to remove verified status in case of violation of the Terms of Use.

## 9. DATA RETENTION

We keep your data only as long as necessary to:

### 9.1. Specific Retention Periods
