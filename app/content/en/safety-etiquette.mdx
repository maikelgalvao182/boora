# Safety and Etiquette Tips for Activities

**Last updated: March 18, 2025**

At Boora, our goal is to create a safe, welcoming, and light environment where people can connect and do things together in the city. Meeting new people is great, but your safety always comes first.

Use common sense and follow these safety and etiquette tips to have a positive experience.

## 1. Before joining an activity

🔹 **Prefer public places**  
Meet in public, busy, and well-lit places.

🔹 **Tell someone you trust**  
Share the activity details with a friend or family member, including location and expected return time.

🔹 **Use Boora’s chat**  
Talk through the in-app chat. It’s safer and helps keep everything organized.

🔹 **Control your transportation**  
Go and return on your own whenever possible. That way, you can leave at any time if needed.

🔹 **Check AI-generated suggestions**  
Boora’s suggestions are meant to inspire, but may not reflect real-time conditions. Verify information about the place before going.

🔹 **Understand the local context**  
Learn about local customs, schedules, rules, and habits to avoid uncomfortable situations.

## 2. During the activity

### Personal safety

✔ **Stay alert**  
Watch your belongings and drinks. Avoid drinking too much alcohol so you stay aware and in control.

✔ **Trust your instincts**  
If something feels off, don’t hesitate to leave. Your safety is the priority.

✔ **Ask for help if needed**  
If you feel unsafe, seek help from staff, authorities, or someone you trust.

### Etiquette and social behavior

✔ **Respect people**  
Be polite, inclusive, and respectful. Avoid sensitive topics if the group isn’t comfortable.

✔ **Value differences**  
Boora connects people with different stories, cultures, and perspectives. That’s part of the experience.

✔ **Split expenses**  
Be prepared to pay your share. Digital payments or cash help.

✔ **Tips**  
Follow local customs when you’re at bars, restaurants, or services.

## 3. After the activity

### Staying connected safely

✅ **Keep contact in the app**  
Continue chatting on Boora and only share personal information with people you trust.

✅ **Report problems**  
If anything inappropriate or unsafe happens, use the reporting tool. Reports are confidential.

### Transportation

✅ **Don’t drive under the influence**  
Use alternative transportation if you’ve been drinking.

✅ **Be careful with rides**  
Avoid accepting rides from strangers, especially if alcohol is involved.

## 4. Blocking and reporting users

🚨 **Block for your safety**  
When you block someone, they can no longer see your profile or contact you.

🚨 **Report serious behavior**  
Blocking does not automatically send a report. If someone violates the rules, report them in the app.
